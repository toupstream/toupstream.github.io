        <h1>Hyperloading</h1>
        <p id = "intro">Hyper loading is a recreational digital zine dedicating to cosmic secrets. Issue no.1 is Black Box, referring to a celestial contraption that was salvaged from deep space, which is considered as a black box by experts. This publication is basically an elaborative manual of fictional cosmic truth.

        <p id = "motivation">Have I ever been upset by ebooks? Hell yeah. Why on earth did they choose to imitate paper books out of such possibilities brought by computers and the internet? 
A legitimate digital zine is ought to be discovered. I’d like to experiment with the digital medium to find out some of the possibilities.
With the interest of science fiction, a black box from the universe became the subject of the initial issue.</p>
        <p id = "process">I was obsessed with the word hyper loading and pasted it on a barber’s pole, resulting in a dynamic logo for the digital zine. “A black box salvaged from deep space.”; departing from this simple idea, I started to create some plausible theories about the universe. To maintain the simpleness of the landing page, I later hid all the information into the celestial contraption and set up entrance and interactions accordingly.</p>
